"""The ``Dataset`` payload + ``AttributeLayer`` store (nodegraph v2).

A :class:`Dataset` is the single thing that flows on the main wire. It is a lazy,
immutable-by-convention bundle: acquisition axis sizes, the metadata dict (drives
metadata-intelligent params — reused from V1.91), an optional image provider, and
an **attribute store** keyed by ``(domain, layer, name)``. Nodes return a *new*
Dataset that shares the upstream store and adds/replaces layers (structural
sharing — cheap to derive).

An :class:`AttributeLayer` is one named array on one domain. For a **lattice**
domain its ``values`` array is shaped by that domain's axes in
:data:`~nodegraph.domains.AXIS_ORDER` (e.g. Frame → ``(M, T)``; Voxel →
``(M,T,Z,Y,X)``; Global → scalar). For a **structure** domain (Label/Point/Track)
``values`` is element-indexed (id → value); its exact layout is refined in a later
phase — this phase nails the lattice.
