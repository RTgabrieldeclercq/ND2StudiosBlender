"""Domain transfer — the generator + the explicit bridge registry (nodegraph v2).

The heart of the model. When a field/attribute defined on domain **A** is consumed
on domain **B**, ``plan_transfer(A, B)`` returns a :class:`TransferPlan`:

* **Between acquisition-lattice domains** the plan is *generated* — coarsening
  **reduces** over the dropped axes, refining **broadcasts** — so no per-pair rule
  is written. Lattice plans **execute for real** on numpy arrays here.
* **Detected structures** (Label/Point/Track) use **explicit bridges** (Voxel↔Label,
  Label↔Point, →Track, Track↔Timepoint, Label/Point↔Frame). These are registered
  with metadata; execution is a later phase (this phase nails the lattice + routing).
  (``Channel`` is a lattice domain since V2.01 §H, so its transfers are generated.)
* **Indirect pairs** (e.g. Voxel→Track, Label→Multipoint) are **routed** by BFS
  over the domain graph (the lattice mega-edge + registered bridges), producing a
  multi-hop plan whose per-hop default is shown.

Qt-free; numpy only.
