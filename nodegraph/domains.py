"""The eleven attribute domains and the acquisition lattice (nodegraph v2).

Two families (see ``CodeLog/ClaudesPlan/V2.00_nodegraph_blender_revamp.md`` §3.2):

* **(a) Acquisition lattice** — coarsenings of the image hypercube over the axes
  ``{m,t,z,y,x}``. Each domain is the finer one with an axis-group aggregated
  away, forming a lattice closed under join (∪ of axes) and meet (∩ of axes)::

      Voxel (m,t,z,y,x) → Plane (m,t,z) → Frame (m,t) ─┬─ Multipoint (m) ─┐
                                                       └─ Timepoint (t) ──┴─ Global ()

  Because it is a lattice, the transfer between any two of these is **generated**
  (coarsen = reduce, refine = broadcast) rather than hand-written — see
  :mod:`nodegraph.transfer`. ``Channel (c)`` is a lattice axis too (V2.01 §H
  resolution: ``c`` is a first-class store/tile/memo axis), so ``Voxel`` is
  ``{m,t,z,c,y,x}`` and ``Channel = {c}`` is a generated lattice domain. Channel
  is **orthogonal** to the spatial/temporal chain, so ``meet`` with it is always
  a named domain but ``join`` across the ``c`` axis is not (e.g.
  ``join(Channel, Frame) = {m,t,c}`` is unnamed) — :func:`join` is therefore
  *partial*. Consequence: coarsening ``Voxel`` to a spatial/temporal domain
  reduces over ``c`` by default (channel-mean); for per-channel results transfer
  to ``Channel`` or select a channel at read time.

* **(b) Detected structures** — ``Label`` (a region of a label mask), ``Point``
  (sub-pixel detections), ``Track`` (a temporal identity running *over* the
  Timepoint domain), ``Mesh`` (a boundary surface: vertices + **faces**). These are
  defined by analysis, not by coarsening, so their transfers are explicit bridges.

  ``Mesh`` (V2.08) is the only domain that carries **topology**. Its irreducible
  content — which vertices form which face — is what no other domain encodes
  (vertices≈Point, the filled region≈Voxel Label, grouping≈Label-over-Points). It is
  stored as three flat, fixed-width **CSR strata** under one domain, addressed by the
  ``layer`` sub-key (``L`` / ``L/vert`` / ``L/face``); see :mod:`nodegraph.mesh`, which
  owns the only sanctioned read/write path.

Qt-free; pure standard library.
