# Track Objects — integration contract

Vendored kernel: `pure_analysis/track_objects.py`
Node name: **Track Objects**
Source branch: `Version-1.45`

---

## 1. Purpose & where the real math lives

Frame-to-frame **object linking**: consumes per-frame object detections
(measurement row-dicts) and assigns a stable `track_id` to each detection across
the time axis, plus `track_length` and a `track_validation` flag. Five
interchangeable linking methods are exposed through one entry point.

All math is **in-repo Python** — there is no external tracking pip package. Three
bodies, all byte-copied into the single vendored `.py`:

| Body | Source | Provides |
|---|---|---|
| Dispatch + centroid linker | `nd2studios/backend/object_tracker.py` | `link_objects`, grouping, centroid Hungarian |
| Cell-Tracker linkers | `nd2studios/backend/celltracker/tracking.py` | `solve_lap`, `link_frames`, `compute_topology_features`, `track_timeseries`, `track_fingerprint`, `track_overlap` |
| SerialTrack PTV | `nd2studios/backend/serialtrack/*.py` | `SerialTracker` (ADMM topology particle tracker) |

SerialTrack here is a from-scratch NumPy/SciPy/Numba port (not MATLAB
SerialTrack, not a pip package).

---

## 2. Entry point — signatures

Primary entry (mutates `rows` in place **and** returns the same list):

```python
def link_objects(
    rows: list[dict],
    max_displacement_px: float = 100.0,
    min_track_length: int = 2,
    min_circularity: float = 0.0,
    max_eccentricity: float = 1.0,
    max_size_diff_frac: float = 1.0,
    max_frame_gap: int = 0,
    method: str = METHOD_CENTROID,
    # --- SerialTrack only ---
    st_mode: str = "Incremental",
    st_n_neighbors: int = 25,
    st_solver: str = "Regularization",
    st_loc_solver: str = "Topology",
    st_n_neighbors_min: int = 1,
    st_smoothness: float = 0.1,
    st_outlier_threshold: float = 5.0,
    st_max_iter: int = 20,
    st_iter_stop_threshold: float = 1e-2,
    st_dist_missing: float = 5.0,
    st_use_prev_results: bool = False,
    # --- Cell-Tracker only ---
    ct_n_neighbors: int = 5,
    ct_topo_weight: float = 0.3,
    ct_area_weight: float = 0.3,
    ct_max_gap: int = 3,
    ct_min_iou: float = 0.1,
    label_masks: dict[tuple[str, int], np.ndarray] | None = None,
    progress_cb: Callable[[float, str], None] | None = None,
) -> list[dict]
```

Convenience wrapper (translates a node param-dict; also converts a µm distance to
pixels via `pixel_size_um`):

```python
def link_objects_with_params(
    rows: list[dict],
    params: dict,
    pixel_size_um: float | None = None,
    label_masks: dict[tuple[str, int], np.ndarray] | None = None,
    progress_cb: Callable[[float, str], None] | None = None,
) -> list[dict]
```

Method constants (pass one to `method=`):

```python
METHOD_CENTROID       = "Centroid (nearest-neighbor)"
METHOD_SERIALTRACK    = "SerialTrack (topology PTV)"
METHOD_CT_TOPOLOGY    = "Cell-Tracker: Topology (Hungarian)"
METHOD_CT_FINGERPRINT = "Cell-Tracker: Spatial Fingerprint"
METHOD_CT_OVERLAP     = "Cell-Tracker: Mask Overlap (IoU)"
TRACKING_METHODS      = [ ...all five... ]
```

Pure leaf math (also exported, callable standalone):

```python
solve_lap(cost: np.ndarray, no_match_cost: float)
    -> (matches: list[(prev,curr)], unmatched_prev: list[int], unmatched_curr: list[int])
link_frames(centroids_prev, centroids_curr, max_dist=30.0,
            topo_prev=None, topo_curr=None, topo_weight=0.3, no_match_cost=None)
    -> (matches, unmatched_prev, unmatched_curr)
compute_topology_features(centroids: (N,2), n_neighbors=5) -> (N, 2*n_neighbors)
track_timeseries(df, max_dist=30.0, n_neighbors=5, use_topology=True,
                 topo_weight=0.3, no_match_cost=None, progress_cb=None) -> DataFrame(+track_id)
track_fingerprint(df, max_dist=30.0, area_weight=0.3, max_gap=3,
                  no_match_cost=None, progress_cb=None) -> DataFrame(+track_id)
track_overlap(df, masks: (T,H,W) int, min_iou=0.1, max_gap=1,
              no_match_cost=None, progress_cb=None) -> DataFrame(+track_id)
```

## 3. Inputs

### `rows` — list of measurement dicts (string-keyed)

| Key | Python type | required? | meaning & constraints |
|---|---|---|---|
| `segmentation_channel` | str | required* | groups detections; coerced via `str(...)`, default `""` if absent |
| `frame` | int | required | 0-based time index; coerced via `int(...)`, default `0` |
| `centroid_y_px` | float | required | object centroid **row (y)**, pixels; `None`→`0.0` |
| `centroid_x_px` | float | required | object centroid **col (x)**, pixels; `None`→`0.0` |
| `area_px` | float | required | object area in pixels; `None`→`0.0` (size gate) |
| `m_position` | int | optional | multipoint index; groups detections; default `0` |
| `label_id` | int | optional | per-frame integer mask id; **required** for CT_TOPOLOGY / CT_FINGERPRINT / CT_OVERLAP; default `0` |
| `circularity` | float | optional | `4π·area/perimeter²`, 0–1; morphology filter input |
| `eccentricity` | float | optional | 0–1; morphology filter input |

\* `segmentation_channel` is not hard-required but is one of the two grouping
keys; omitting it lumps everything into group `("", 0)`.

Rows may carry any number of extra keys — they are preserved untouched.

### `label_masks` — only for `METHOD_CT_OVERLAP`

| Item | type | shape | dtype | axis order | meaning |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| key | `tuple[str, int]` | — | — | — | `(segmentation_channel, m_position)` — must match a group |
| value | `np.ndarray` | `(T, H, W)` | integer label image | `T` = frame, then `(y, x)` | pixel value = the object's `label_id` in that frame |

For a single-group run, a mis-keyed dict with exactly one entry is tolerated (the
sole value is used). When a group's masks are missing, CT_OVERLAP silently
**falls back** to the fingerprint linker.

### `progress_cb`

`Callable[[float, str], None]` — fraction in `[0,1]` + status message. Optional.

Params that don't apply to the chosen method are accepted and ignored.

---

## 5. Output

`link_objects` returns the **same** `list[dict]` object it was given (identity
preserved), with three keys **added/overwritten on every row**:

| Key | dtype | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `track_id` | `int` or `None` | stable track identity; `None` if the row was excluded (morphology filter) or its final track spans fewer than `min_track_length` frames |
| `track_length` | `int` | number of frames the row's track spans (`1` if untracked/excluded) |
| `track_validation` | `str` or `None` | `"unvalidated"` when `track_id is not None`, else `None` |

`track_id`s are **1-based and globally unique across all `(channel, m_position)`
groups** (a shared counter continues across groups).

The `track_*` leaf functions (`track_timeseries`, `track_fingerprint`,
`track_overlap`) instead return a **copy** of the input DataFrame with a
`track_id` column (`int`, `-1` = unassigned). `solve_lap` / `link_frames` return
plain Python index lists/tuples; `compute_topology_features` returns an
`(N, 2*n_neighbors)` float array (first block = sorted neighbor distances, second
= sorted angular gaps).

---

## 6. Conventions & GOTCHAS (the real integration risk)

1. **Mutate-in-place contract.** `link_objects` edits the dicts you pass and
   returns the *same list*. Do not assume a fresh copy. If you need to preserve
   the originals, deep-copy the rows before calling.
2. **Axis order is `(y, x)` = `(row, col)`.** Centroids are read from
   `centroid_y_px` / `centroid_x_px` and stacked as `[y, x]` internally. Feed
   `compute_topology_features` / `link_frames` an `(N, 2)` array in `[y, x]`
   order to match.
3. **Units are pixels.** All distances (`max_displacement_px`, SerialTrack
   `f_o_s`, CT `max_dist`) are pixels. The GUI wrapper `link_objects_with_params`
   is the *only* place a µm→px conversion happens (`max_distance / pixel_size_um`
   when `distance_unit == "µm"`).
4. **Grouping happens inside `link_objects`.** Detections are grouped by
   `(str(segmentation_channel), int(m_position))`; linking runs independently per
   group; `track_id`s never collide across groups (shared mutable `next_id`
   counter). Do **not** pre-split by channel/position — pass all rows at once.
5. **`None`→`0.0` coercion.** `centroid_y_px`, `centroid_x_px`, `area_px` are read
   through helpers that map `None`/missing to `0.0`. A row with a real centroid at
   the origin and a row with missing centroids are indistinguishable.
6. **CT_OVERLAP `label` must equal the mask id.** For every row,
   `label_id` must equal the integer value painted for that object in
   `masks[frame]`. Objects present in the mask but absent from `rows` (filtered
   out upstream) are ignored so they can't steal a link. `masks` must be `(T,H,W)`
   and integer; `masks.ndim != 3` raises `ValueError`.
7. **CT_OVERLAP mask fallback.** If `label_masks` has no entry for a group (and
   isn't a single-entry dict), that group silently falls back to
   `track_fingerprint` — you still get tracks, but not IoU-based ones.
8. **Two-frame minimum.** Every linker early-returns (no links) when a group spans
   fewer than 2 frames with detections; those rows stay `track_id=None`.
9. **Morphology pre-filter.** Rows failing `min_circularity` / `max_eccentricity`
   are dropped from tracking entirely (stay `track_id=None`) — they are not merely
   down-weighted.
10. **Frame index doubles as a time axis AND (for overlap) a mask index.** For
    CT_OVERLAP, `frame` values index into `masks` (`masks[frame]`); frames `>=
    masks.shape[0]` are skipped.
11. **`min_track_length` is applied last.** All methods link first; the caller-side
    post-pass then nulls `track_id` for tracks shorter than `min_track_length` (but
    still records their `track_length`).
12. **Logging collision (cosmetic).** All vendored modules share one rebound `log`
    logger — log records emit under a single logger name. No effect on results.

## 7. Dependencies

| Package | pip name | when needed | why |
|---|---|---|---|
| numpy | `numpy` | **import-time** | arrays everywhere |
| scipy | `scipy` | **import-time** | `linear_sum_assignment`, `cKDTree`, sparse solve, interpolators, `ndimage` |
| numba | `numba` | **import-time** | JIT kernels in SerialTrack `detection.py` / `matching.py` are `@nb.njit`-decorated at module load |
| pandas | `pandas` | **import-time** | `celltracker/tracking.py` imports it at top level; the CT/overlap linkers build DataFrames |
| scikit-image | `scikit-image` | lazy (runtime) | only inside SerialTrack `ParticleDetector` PSF deconvolution path — **not reached** by the coordinate/row-dict tracking path |
| scikit-learn | `scikit-learn` | **lazy** (runtime) | only SerialTrack POD-GPR warm start (`st_use_prev_results=True` on 7+ frames); a clear `RuntimeError` is raised if missing |

Import-time set to run *any* method: `numpy scipy numba pandas`. (numba is
import-time purely because the SerialTrack detection/matching kernels decorate at
load — even the non-SerialTrack methods can't import the module without it.)

---

## 8. Failure modes / edge cases

- **Empty `rows`** → returned unchanged (each row would have gotten the three keys,
  but there are none).
- **Single frame / single detection per group** → no links; all rows `track_id=None`.
- **`min_track_length` too high** → everything nulled to `track_id=None`.
- **CT_OVERLAP with wrong mask shape** → `ValueError("track_overlap needs (T,H,W) masks…")`.
- **CT_OVERLAP masks missing for a group** → silent fallback to fingerprint linker.
- **SerialTrack `st_use_prev_results=True`, 7+ frames, no scikit-learn** →
  `RuntimeError` telling the user to install scikit-learn or turn the option off.
- **numba / pandas not installed** → `ImportError` at *module import* (they are
  top-level in the vendored sources), before any method runs.
- **Degenerate geometry** (fewer points than needed for a simplex / topology
  descriptor) → interpolators fall back to nearest-neighbour and topology features
  return zeros; no crash.

## 9. Minimal runnable example

```python
import numpy as np
import track_objects as T   # from pure_analysis/

# 3 objects drifting +2 px/frame across 4 frames, one channel, one position
base = np.array([[10., 10.], [50., 50.], [90., 20.]])
rows = []
for fr in range(4):
    for lbl, (cy, cx) in enumerate(base + fr * 2.0, start=1):
        rows.append(dict(
            segmentation_channel="GFP", m_position=0, frame=fr, label_id=lbl,
            centroid_y_px=float(cy), centroid_x_px=float(cx), area_px=100.0,
            circularity=0.9, eccentricity=0.2,
        ))

T.link_objects(rows, max_displacement_px=20.0, min_track_length=2,
               method=T.METHOD_CENTROID)

ids = sorted({r["track_id"] for r in rows if r["track_id"] is not None})
print(ids)                     # -> [1, 2, 3]   (3 tracks, each length 4)
print(rows[0]["track_length"]) # -> 4
print(rows[0]["track_validation"])  # -> "unvalidated"

# CT_OVERLAP needs an (T,H,W) integer label image whose ids == label_id:
masks = np.zeros((4, 120, 120), np.int32)
for fr in range(4):
    for lbl, (cy, cx) in enumerate(base + fr * 2.0, start=1):
        y0, x0 = int(cy), int(cx)
        masks[fr, y0:y0+8, x0:x0+8] = lbl
rows2 = [dict(r) for r in rows]      # link_objects mutates — copy first
T.link_objects(rows2, max_displacement_px=20.0, min_track_length=2,
               method=T.METHOD_CT_OVERLAP, ct_min_iou=0.1,
               label_masks={("GFP", 0): masks})
```

Expected: all five `METHOD_*` values yield `track_id`s `[1, 2, 3]` on this input.

---

## 10. Pipeline wiring (original ND2Studios flow)

- **Upstream (feeds this kernel):** a segmentation node (StarDist / Nuclei /
  granule) produces per-frame integer label masks, then a **measurement** node
  (`compute_measurements`) turns each labeled object into a row-dict with
  `segmentation_channel`, `frame`, `m_position`, `label_id`, `centroid_y_px`,
  `centroid_x_px`, `area_px`, `circularity`, `eccentricity`. Those row-dicts are
  exactly the `rows` list. For `METHOD_CT_OVERLAP`, the same segmentation masks are
  passed through as `label_masks[(channel, m_position)] = (T,H,W)`.
- **This node:** groups rows by `(channel, m_position)`, links per group, writes
  `track_id` / `track_length` / `track_validation` back onto each row in place.
- **Downstream (consumes the output):** Review / if-else pipeline steps and track
  visualisation read `track_id` to draw trajectories and to gate per-track logic.
  The caller owns *all* prep — file I/O, per-multipoint/per-timepoint iteration,
  cropping, downsampling, registration, exclusion — none of that is in this kernel.

## 11. Provenance

Byte-copied verbatim from branch **`Version-1.45`**, in this file order:

```
nd2studios/backend/serialtrack/config.py
nd2studios/backend/serialtrack/outliers.py
nd2studios/backend/serialtrack/matching.py
nd2studios/backend/serialtrack/detection.py
nd2studios/backend/serialtrack/regularization.py
nd2studios/backend/serialtrack/fields.py
nd2studios/backend/serialtrack/prediction.py
nd2studios/backend/serialtrack/trajectories.py
nd2studios/backend/serialtrack/tracking.py
nd2studios/backend/celltracker/tracking.py
nd2studios/backend/object_tracker.py
```

`regularization.py`, `fields.py`, and `prediction.py` were **not** in the
original "vendor these" list but are transitively imported by SerialTrack's
`tracking.py` (the ADMM global-step solvers, strain fields, and POD-GPR warm
start), so they were vendored too to satisfy the zero-relative-import rule.

Edits (import-only): eleven `from __future__ import annotations` collapsed to one
at top; all `from .` relative imports and the two `from nd2studios.backend.*`
lazy imports removed (every referenced symbol is defined in-file). Third-party
import strategy kept verbatim: numba/scipy/pandas top-level, scikit-learn lazy.
No name collisions required renaming; no UI/registry/compute-path members dropped.

## 12. SerialTrack parity repairs (2026-07-31)

The vendored SerialTrack was validated against the **upstream MATLAB**
(<https://github.com/FranckLab/SerialTrack>) and FranckLab's own distributed
example data — `SerialTrack2D_data` / `SerialTrack3D_data`, whose
`img_syn_hardpar/*/imposed_disp.mat` carry per-bead ground truth (`x0`, `x1{k}`,
`u{k}`) and two of whose 3-D cases also ship `results_3D_hardpar.mat`, the
detections/links/displacements MATLAB itself produced from those volumes.

The reproducible gate is **`scripts/_serialtrack_validate.py`** (suites:
`detect`, `link`, `pipeline`, `parity`, `invariant`). Read its module docstring
before touching any of this: the MATLAB↔numpy conventions are subtle (the 2-D
generator writes its TIFFs transposed and `funReadImage2.m` transposes them
back), and every number below is meaningless if they are applied twice.

Nine defects were found and fixed. Each is a *behaviour* change, so a graph
saved before this date will produce different — better — numbers.

### Detection (also mirrored into `bead_detect.py`, which carries a byte-copy)

1. **`_radial_symmetry_3d` measured its gradient votes from the wrong origin.**
   `radialcenter3dvec.m` uses the intensity centroid **only** in the weight
   denominator `q = |∇I|²/d`; the voxel positions that enter the normal
   equations are measured from the **patch centre**, because the returned offset
   is added to the integer voxel the patch was cut around. The port subtracted
   the centroid from both, dropping the centroid offset from the answer.
   *Localisation error 0.340 px → 0.0637 px, against MATLAB's 0.0643 px; the
   corrected kernel agrees with a literal transcription of the MATLAB to 3.3e-16.*
2. **The TPT seed was sub-voxel, so the offset was double-counted.**
   `locateParticles.m` rounds the *binary* blob centroid to an integer voxel and
   `radialcenter3dvec` refines from there. The port added the patch-relative
   offset to an *unrounded* intensity-weighted centroid. Also fixed: MATLAB's
   strict `> minSize & < maxSize` size gate, and `padNoise.m`'s near-zero
   padding (the port reflected, mirroring bead intensity into the border).
3. **The LoG kernel was 25 taps where MATLAB's is 7.** `fspecial('log', ceil(σ)*2+1, σ)`
   is hard-truncated at bead scale; `scipy.ndimage.gaussian_laplace` truncates at
   4σ. Added `_fspecial_log`.
4. **The local-maximum footprint was 13×13 where MATLAB's is 7×7**
   (`strel('square', 2σ+1)`), suppressing every second particle in a dense field.
   Also: MATLAB thresholds the *size-masked* image, and its LoG path applies the
   **minimum** size filter only (`f_detect_particles.m`'s
   `if sum(mean(BW3(:))) < 1, BW3 = BW1` is always true).
   *Together, 3+4 take 2-D yield from 1543/3146 to 3075/3146 beads and median
   error from 0.26 px to 0.147 px.*

### Global step

5. **`smoothness` was a thin-plate-spline RBF ridge, not `regularizeNd`.** These
   are different operators with different parameterisations — the RBF is O(N³) in
   the scattered-point count and extrapolates with a growing polynomial, and the
   *same numeric value* means something unrelated. Replaced with a real
   `regularizeNd` port (`regularize_nd` / `regularize_nd_multi`): a sparse
   least-squares gridfit whose fidelity rows are the multilinear cell weights and
   whose smoothness rows are the numerical 2nd derivative scaled by
   `smoothness · √(N/N_eqn) · span²` — the scaling that makes the knob mean the
   same thing at any grid resolution or axis unit. All components share one
   factorisation.
6. **Grid → particle interpolation Delaunay-triangulated a regular lattice**, on
   every ADMM iteration, for every component — **76 % of total runtime** — and
   was wrong twice over: the triangulation imposes an arbitrary diagonal (so the
   interpolant is direction-biased rather than multilinear), and `fill_value=0`
   zeroed the update for every particle outside the convex hull instead of
   extrapolating, pinning the field at the ROI edges. Now
   `RegularGridInterpolator` with linear extrapolation, matching MATLAB's
   `scatteredInterpolant(...,'linear','linear')`. *Tracking ratio on 2-D
   cumulative rotation 96.6 % → 100 %; the whole loop 12× faster.*
   The same hull-zeroing was present in the *unsmoothed* scatter→grid path —
   fixed via `_linear_extrap_interpolate` (detrend → interpolate → retrend).
7. **`MAX_GRID_NODES` guard** (a deliberate deviation): upstream derives
   `sxyz = min(round(0.5·f_o_s), 20)` and never revisits it, which is fine at the
   15–60 px `f_o_s` its own examples use. A caller passing a few-px `f_o_s` — what
   a micron-denominated "max displacement" becomes at coarse pixel sizes — got a
   1 px lattice over the whole frame: 4·10⁶ nodes on a 2048² image, and a
   4·10⁶-square sparse solve. Not an error; an apparent hang.

### ADMM loop

8. **`update_f_o_s` decayed the search window instead of flooring it.**
   `f_track_serial_match3D.m:302` is `f_o_s = max([60; median+0.5·IQR; …])` where
   the literal **is** the configured `MPTPara.f_o_s` — so the update can only ever
   *raise* the window. The port used `max(2, 0.1·f_o_s_current)`, a geometric
   decay: 60 → 6 → 2 → 2… Two iterations in, no link longer than 2 px survives.
   *This alone reduced 3-D cumulative stretch/shear to a 0.3 % tracking ratio.*
   Also switched the quantiles to MATLAB's Hazen convention.
9. **Three smaller control-flow divergences**, all verified on both sides:
   candidate selection was an *uncapped* ball query where
   `f_track_neightopo_match3.m:122` takes the **K nearest** and *then* filters by
   radius (≈470 candidates vs 25 at `f_o_s = 60` — a different answer *and*
   O(n_cand·K) more work); the nearest-neighbour matcher applied an `f_o_s` gate
   that upstream has commented out, letting the late iterations return no matches
   and terminate the loop on a path upstream does not have; and `match_ratio`
   counted *post*-outlier links where MATLAB counts raw ones, so the `> 0.999`
   convergence counter could never increment.

Plus two robustness repairs with no upstream counterpart: the global-step update
is clamped to the current field of search (an update larger than that cannot
help — the next local step will not accept a link that long — and unclamped it
feeds back to 1e81 px in four iterations, then dies inside `cKDTree` with
"data must be finite"); and `_run_tracking` now infers dimensionality from the
coordinates, since `TrackingConfig.ndim` derives from `roi_z`, which only
`track_images` ever set — so 3-column input silently reported 2-D.

### Node-level

`_compute_track_objects` passed only 2 of the 11 `st_*` knobs; the other 9 fell
back to `link_objects`' signature defaults, which are SerialTrack's **3-D**
constants — while the node's `z_kind` guard guarantees the data is 2-D. It now
pins the 2-D set from `Example_main_2D_hardpar_inc_coords_only.m`, which is this
node's exact use case (pre-detected coordinates, no image re-detection):
`gbSolver 3 (ADMM)`, `smoothness 1e-2`, `outlrThres 2`, `distMissing 2`,
`iterStopThres 1e-2`, `locSolver 1`, `n_neighborsMin 1`, `maxIterNum 20`. The
`st_smoothness` socket default moved 0.1 → 0.01 for the same reason.

### Where it stands

With the paper's own Table 3 parameters, fed exact coordinates
(`--suite link`), **every link the tracker makes is to the correct particle**
(`correct` = 1.0000 in 7 of 8 cases, 0.9958 in the last). Rigid-body
displacement recovery is at machine precision (1e-14 px for translation,
1e-11 px for a 100° rotation). Tracking ratios follow the paper's Fig. 3 shape,
including the rotation dip where reference/deformed frame overlap is smallest.
Detection matches the golden MATLAB output to 4 decimal places on every frame a
golden exists for.
