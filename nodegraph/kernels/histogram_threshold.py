"""histogram_threshold.py — vendored Histogram Threshold Segmenter kernel.

PURPOSE
    Single-frame, histogram-driven intensity-threshold segmentation of a 2-D
    image. Given an already-prepared 2-D integer frame, it thresholds it (one
    of 4 methods x 4 directions), cleans the binary mask with morphology,
    labels connected components, and measures per-region properties. Returns a
    SegmentationResult (mask + labels + regions + histogram + provenance).

WHERE THE REAL MATH LIVES
    In-repo. The entire algorithm is native to this repository — there is NO
    external analysis package behind it. It is built on top of stock
    scikit-image (skimage.filters / .morphology / .measure / .segmentation) and
    scipy.ndimage primitives; the orchestration, thresholding directions,
    hysteresis inversion trick, percentile->intensity mapping, and region
    measurement are all repo code.

PROVENANCE (branch: Version-1.45)
    Vendored verbatim (concatenated, byte-for-byte) from:
      nd2studios/backend/analysis/histothresh/config.py
      nd2studios/backend/analysis/histothresh/histogram.py
      nd2studios/backend/analysis/histothresh/thresholds.py
      nd2studios/backend/analysis/histothresh/morphology.py
      nd2studios/backend/analysis/histothresh/validation.py
      nd2studios/backend/analysis/histothresh/identifier.py
    The package __init__.py re-export shim was intentionally NOT vendored.
    NOT vendored (registry / prep / looping — caller's job):
      histogram_threshold_pipeline.py, plane_runner.py, source_utils.py.

VENDORED VERBATIM; IMPORTS NOTHING FROM nd2studios; CALLER OWNS ALL PREP.
    (no file I/O, no per-multipoint/per-timepoint looping, no
    crop/downsample/registration/exclusion — those are the caller's job.)

EDITS APPLIED (only what the vendoring rules permit)
    (a) Stripped all intra-package `from .validation/.histogram/.config/...`
        relative imports; every referenced symbol is now DEFINED in this file.
    (a) Collapsed the six per-file `from __future__ import annotations` lines
        into the single one below (a future-import must be the first statement
        of a module; duplicates deeper in the file are a SyntaxError).
    (b) BUG FIX 2026-07-28 in `threshold_hysteresis` (the ONE semantic deviation
        from the v1 source): its seeds are now offset by one count so the
        skimage `>` comparison implements the `>=`/`<=` contract its own
        docstring specifies. Without it, hysteresis was exclusive while every
        other method (single / percentile / relative, all of which route through
        `threshold_single`) was inclusive, so an object plateau sitting exactly
        at `strict` produced an EMPTY mask. v1 has the same defect upstream —
        see the note on the function.
    No private helpers were renamed (no name collisions across the 6 files).

DROPPED UI/REGISTRY-ONLY MEMBERS
    None. These six source files contain no get_params()/ParamSpec, no
    @Registry.register decorators, and no ParamEditor hooks — they were already
    the pure compute core. Everything here is on the compute path and is kept.
    (The registry/pipeline wrapper that DID carry those lived in the
    not-vendored histogram_threshold_pipeline.py.)

CONVENIENCE
    Construct a ThresholdConfig directly and pass it to
    HistogramThresholdSegmenter(config).run(image, ...). A headless helper,
    make_config(**kwargs), is provided at the bottom of this file; it forces
    bit_depth_strict=False by default (see the .md GOTCHAS — the dataclass
    default is strict=True, which raises BitDepthError on rescaled TIFFs).

    contract in the paragraph above and disagreeing with :func:`threshold_single` (and

    ``strict=192`` seeded NOTHING and hysteresis returned an empty mask where percentile
    at the same resolved threshold returned every object. Since this function's input is
    guaranteed integer (``validate_bit_depth`` rejects float dtype), offsetting each seed
