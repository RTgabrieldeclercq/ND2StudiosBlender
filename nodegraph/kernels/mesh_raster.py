"""Mesh → voxel rasterization (nodegraph v2, V2.08).

Two interior tests, one code path. Both go through the **vendored**
:func:`nodegraph.kernels.granule_volume_mask.build_granule_masks`, which is duck-typed on
``.boundaries`` / ``.vertices_um`` / ``.delaunay`` / ``.density`` and whose whole inside
test is ``tri.find_simplex(centers) >= 0``. So a one-method shim exposing ``find_simplex``
drops straight in and inherits the vendored bbox walk, the µm smoothing, hole filling and
small-component removal **with zero kernel edits** — and, critically, without re-deriving
the kernel's index rule (voxel ``(z,y,x)`` has world centre ``(x*dx, y*dy, z*dz)``, no
half-voxel offset), which is the single easiest place to ship a half-voxel shift.

* ``mode="convex"`` — pass ``delaunay=None`` and let the kernel build its own
  ``Delaunay(verts)``. This is **bit-for-bit what the fused node already did**: the
  alpha-shape producer stores the *unfiltered* ``Delaunay``, and the union of a Delaunay
  triangulation's simplices is exactly the convex hull of its points, so
  ``find_simplex >= 0`` has always been a convex-hull membership test in every mode.
* ``mode="watertight"`` — pass :class:`FaceParity`, an even-odd ray-cast over the mesh's
  **faces**. This is the only test that respects concavity, so it is what finally makes
  the voxel mask agree with the analytic ``volume_um3`` / ``surface_area_um2`` the
  tessellation already reports. Even-odd parity is **orientation-independent**, which is
  required here: the vendored producers key ``_boundary_faces`` on a sorted vertex triple
  but store the raw unsorted one, and ``ConvexHull.equations`` is discarded, so winding is
  arbitrary — a signed / generalized winding number would silently mis-fill without an
  orientation-repair pass first.

Vertices arrive in **voxel ``(z,y,x)``** (the Mesh domain's storage convention), so the
parity test runs entirely in voxel space with no unit conversion at all. Only the convex
path converts to the kernel's world ``(x,y,z)`` µm.

numpy for the parity test; scipy only via the vendored kernel (lazily imported there).

# Exact hits are the COMMON case here, not a corner case: mesh vertices routinely sit on
# integer grid lines (marching cubes emits them there, and a synthetic axis-aligned test
# mesh is all of them), while the sample points ARE the integer lattice. Two failure modes
# follow, and both need the ray origin nudged off the lattice:
#   * in (z,y): a ray through a shared edge/vertex is counted by BOTH triangles, which
#     flips parity for the whole rest of the row;
#   * along x: a sample lying exactly ON a face is decided by float noise — barycentric
#     interpolation of a face at x=6 returns 6.000000000000001, so a strict comparison
#     silently reverses.
# Three mutually incommensurate offsets make every one of those unreachable. The cost is
# sampling ~1e-4 voxel off centre, and the resulting convention is HALF-OPEN at surfaces
# (a voxel centre exactly on the boundary reads as outside). That is inherent to parity —
# it cannot include both the near and far face of the same solid — and differs from the
# convex path's closed ``find_simplex >= 0`` by at most one voxel layer, on faces that lie
# exactly on the sampling lattice.

    Rays travel along **+x**, so the work is grouped per ``(z, y)`` ray: one pass over the
